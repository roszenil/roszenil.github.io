In this project, I construct a data pipeline which intakes raw `.wav` files, and
then uses machine learning to predict the genre of the track. We first do a
frequency-space transformation (similar to the Fourier transform), and then do
randomized dimension reduction on the resulting array. Finally, we put the
dimension-reduced signal through a naive Bayes classifier, which we train on
about 500 sample tracks...
