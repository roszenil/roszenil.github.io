I learned a lot while building this website; I hope to share it so that it might
be helpful for anyone trying to do the same. I'm sure you'll notice that I'm far
from an expert in the subjects we're going to explore here; this is my first
foray into web development. If you have any corrections, or things I've
misunderstood, I'd love to hear about it! Just post a comment.

The site is built using [Jekyll][1], using the theme [Minimal Mistakes][2]. I
host it on [Github pages][3], and purchased and manage my domain through
[Google Domains][4]. We'll go through each of these steps in detail. I'll assume
that you have the up-to-date versions of Ruby and Jekyll on your local
machine. I'm going through all this in macOS, which may affect some of the shell
commands I give, but translating to Windows shouldn't be too hard.

## Making a site with Minimal Mistakes

The website for Minimal Mistakes includes a great quick-start guide; I
recommend the [Starting with `jekyll new`][11] section as a place to
start. Using this you shoudl be able to establish a base site with some
simple demonstration content.

### Enabling MathJax

In order to enable [MathJax][5], which renders the mathematical equations you see in
my posts, you'll need to edit the file `scripts.html` contained in the folder
`_includes/` to include a line enabling MathJax. However, you'll want to avoid
overwriting the contents of the default `scripts.html`.

So, we need to find where `bundle` is storing the Gem for Minimal Mistakes. To
find this, do 

	bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll 

If you just want to navigate directly to that directory, do 

	cd $(bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll)
	
Now you can copy the default `scripts.html` into your site:

	cp _includes/scripts.html /path/to/site/_includes/scripts.html
	
Open the copied `scripts.html` in your editor of choice,[^fnote1] and add the
following lines at the end: 

{% highlight html %} 
{% raw %} 
{% if page.mathjax %}
<script type="text/javascript" async
src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script> 
{% endif %} 
{% endraw %} 
{% endhighlight %}

And you're done![^fnote2]  Now, you can type `$$x_1$$` to see $$x_1$$, and so
on. The `$$...$$` syntax will generate inline math if used inline, and will
generate a display equation if used on its own line. So, if one enters

	$$ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz $$

Then the rendered equation appears as so:

$$ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz $$

### Customize Font Sizes

I found the fonts a bit oversized, so I wanted to change the size for the
posts. In order to do this, you need to copy **the entire folder** which
contains all the relevant scss files. In order to do this, do

	cd $(bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll)
	cp -r _sass /path/to/site
	
Now, after much digging through the GitHub issues,[^fnote3] I found that the
file to edit here is `_sass/_reset.scss`. In my site, the relevant chunk of text
looks like

{% highlight html %}
  @include breakpoint($medium) {
    font-size: 13px;
  }

  @include breakpoint($large) {
    font-size: 15px;
  }

  @include breakpoint($x-large) {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Once this file has been edited, you should see the font size reduced in your
page. 

## Getting it on GitHub Pages

Okay, now we write a bunch of nonsense, find some beautiful pictures at
[Unsplash][7] to use as headers, and we're ready to publish the thing on GitHub
Pages. I'll first go through as though we don't want to use a custom domain, so
that the website will be exposed at `USERNAME.github.io`. 

### Enabling `jekyll-remote-theme`

First of all, make sure that you're using the `remote-theme` jekyll plugin,
which allows you to use any jekyll theme that is GitHub hosted, rather than only
the few that are officially supported. This process is outlined on the Minimal
Mistakes website, but I'll go through it here.

First, **in your `_config.yml` file**, enable the plugin by including it in the
`plugins` list, via

	plugins:
	  - jekyll-remote-theme

If you have other plugins you want to use (I use `jekyll-feed`), then add them
to this list as well. Designate the `remote_theme` variable, but do so **after
setting the theme**, so that you have in your config file

	theme: "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
	remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"

Finally, in your `Gemfile`, add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"`.

### Push it to the repository

GitHub pages looks for a repository that follows the naming convention
`USERNAME.github.io`. So, for example, since my GitHub username is
`peterewills`, the repository for the source of this site is at
`https://www.github.com/peterewills/peterewills.github.io`. 

Once you've created such a repository, initialize a git repo on your site by
going into `path/to/your/site` and doing `git init`. Then, do

	git remote add origin https://www.github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io
	
and then commit and push. (If you're unfamiliar with using git, I recommend
[either][7] of [these][8] tutorials.) You'll get an email that your page build
was successful, but you're "using an unsupported theme." Don't worry about this;
it happens whenever you use `remote-theme`. 

You now should be able to navigate to `USERNAME.github.io` and see your page!

## Using a Custom Domain

Suppose you'd prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mydomain.pizza` (this is
actually a real, and available, domain name). There are lots of ways to do this;
I did it through [Google Domains][9], so I'll go through those steps.

First, you go to [Google Domains][9], pick out the domain you want, and register
it. For this example, we'll assume you went with `mydomain.pizza`. You should
now see it appear under the **My Domains** tab on the right side of the
page. You should see a domain called `mydomain.pizza` and a **DNS** option. This
is what we need to edit.

We need to configure the DNS behavior of our domain so that it points at the IP
address where GitHub Pages is hosting it. On the DNS page, scroll down to
**Custom Resource Records**. You'll want to add three custom resource records;
two "host" resource records (designated by an A) and one "alias" resource record
(designated by CNAME). GitHub pages exposes its sites at IP addresses
192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154. So, you'll want to add both of these as host
resource records. You'll want to add your GitHub Pages url `USERNAME.github.io`
as an alias record. By the time you've added the three, your list of resource
records should look like the example below.

![](/assets/images/custom_resource.png)

So, now your url (`mydomain.pizza`) knows that it is an alias for
`USERNAME.github.io`, but we still have to specify this aliasing on the GitHub
end of things. 

To do this, simply make a text file called `CNAME` and include on the first line

	mydomain.pizza
	
This is the entire contents of the text file `CNAME`. Once this is pushed to the
repository `USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io`, the appropriate settings should
automatically update themselves. To check this, go to the respository settings,
scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" settings, and look under "Custom domain." You
should see something like the following:

![](/assets/images/github_repo.png)

If the DNS record of your Google domain has not yet been updated, then you will
see `Your site is ready to be published mydomain.pizza` on a yellow
background. Note that it sometimes takes up to 48 hours for DNS records to
update, so be patient.

## Conclusion

Once the DNS records have updated, you should be able to see your site at
`mydomain.pizza`. You can check out [the repository for my site][10] to see
examples of what I've gone through here; including my `CNAME` file, my
`_include/scripts.html` file that enables MathJax, and my `_config.yml`
file. Please let me know, either by email or in the comments, if you have any
questions or corrections!

[^fnote1]: Presumably emacs.

[^fnote2]: Some [older blog posts][6] discuss the process of adding kramdown as
	the markdown rendering engine, but this is default behavior for Jekyll 3.x,
	so there's no need to do this step.

[^fnote3]: Michael, the guy who built Minimal Mistakes, is really wonderful
    about responding to issues on GitHub, which are really used as a support
    forum for people using the theme who have no experience in web development
    (such as myself).
