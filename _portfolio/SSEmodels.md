# State dependent diversification models
## Background
The goal of this workshop is to get you familiarized with state dependent diversification models. In the literature they are called state dependent speciation and extinction, because the models link the value of the states to the rates of speciation and extinction. This idea will be clearer as we work through the workshop excercises.

Note: This workshop is slowly evolving so materials will be changing over time.
