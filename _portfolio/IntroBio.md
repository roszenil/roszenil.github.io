## 04/30/2020. Viral Evolution
**Our expectation for this week:**

1. You should invest a total of 70 minutes reading, watching videos, and answering some
key questions about what you are reading and seeing. This is equivalent to in-class
lecture and processing of information.
2. Independent study (approximately 1 hour) clarifying what you could not answer from
above. Additional help is available at office hours during regularly scheduled lecture time
(12-1:10PM, Tuesday and Thursdays).

- Also, check out the discussion on the morphology (shape) of viruses and the 
different types of genomes that they have 


**Self Study**
1. Give a step by step description of the lytic cycle. How does the lysogenic cycle 
differ from the lytic cycle? (medium)

5. What is a reason why new viruses are hard to classify? To answer: check out the 
short reading on the discovery of the coronavirus. (easy) 
6. What are the two types of testing being done for Coronavirus? Describe how 
these tests reveal different information. (hard) o What is the goal of a vaccine?
7. Describe how an inactivated or weakened virus can be used in a vaccine.

Very long read but I would like you to focus on the early sections (Chapter 1) of the reading that focus on the historical thought and early experiments on the origin of life.
The later sections describe recent hypotheses and experiments on the origin of life.
They are very technical, but if you are interested, there is a lot of great info
