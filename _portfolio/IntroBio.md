Post your questions in this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/184Uku1DBZvJqKlpaSY99-R7RwcmPzOPnDL6bQmFDlgU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Mendelian Genetics 03/24/2019
### Created by Tom Iwanicki and Rosana Zenil-Ferguson
*“Merely memorizing Mendel’s crosses and ratios is missing the beauty of his work”* - Dr. Shirley
Tilghman.

### Our expectation for this week:
1. You should invest a total of 70 minutes reading, watching videos, and answering some
key questions about what you are reading and seeing. This is equivalent to in-class
lecture and processing of information.
2. Independent study (approximately 1 hour) clarifying what you could not answer from
above. Additional help is available at office hours during regularly scheduled lecture time
(12-1:10PM, Tuesday and Thursdays).

### Activities
A. Read The Laws of Inheritance: A Journey from Mendel’s Abbey to Iceland by Shirley
Tilghman (25 minutes) [link](https://explorebiology.org/collections/genetics/the-laws-of-inheritance:-a-journey-from-mendel%E2%80%99s-abbey-to-iceland)
B. Answer the ‘Explorer’s Questions’ in the reading (15 minutes)
C. Use the following critical thinking questions to guide your reading and comprehension of
key concepts (30 minutes):
1. Review and define the concepts: cross, trait, allele, genotype, phenotype, parental
generation, F1, F2, dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous, true breeding.
How do they relate to each other? (Difficulty: Medium)
2. Mendel made a major impact on science and humanity, but his journey was a rather
unusual one. What surprised you the most about Mendel as a person? (Difficulty: Easy)
3. Which are some of the basic traits of peas and why did Mendel choose to study such
traits? (Difficulty: Medium)
4. What is the main property of a “law” in science? (Difficulty: Easy)
5. Are Mendelian laws of inheritance always true? How so? (Difficulty: Medium)
6. Figure 3 from the reading has the results of the first series of crosses. Why is this result
interesting? How do you explain these results with Punnett squares? (Difficulty: Medium)
7. Figure 4 has the results of the second series of crosses. What are the main differences
with Figure 3? (Difficulty: Medium)
8. How many alleles are needed to understand the law of independent assortment
(independent segregation of traits in the reading)? Hint: Think about the number of traits
first. (Difficulty: Medium)
9. In Figure 5. There is a diagram of alleles for tall plants and how they are being passed to
the next generation. How does this diagram relate to meiosis? (Difficulty: Hard)
10. In Figure 6a. How do you explain the values of the rows and the columns (the pollen and
the ovules listed there) of the Punnett square? (Difficulty: Hard)
11. When does the 9:3:3:1 ratio hold? When this ratio doesn’t hold?- Hint: think about
chromosomes and meiosis (Difficulty: Medium)
12. What is a multigenic trait? Do they obey Mendelian rules? (Difficulty: Medium)
13. Amongst humans, how does our DNA differ? (Difficulty: Easy)
14. What is GWAS and why is it important? (Difficulty: Easy)
D) To help self study and the lab (1hr)
Practice problems of Punnett squares from the lab, OpenStax books and from
