The Zenil-Ferguson lab at the University of Kentucky develops new mathematical models and statistical tools to solve key questions of plant macroevolution. Our main focus is to understand how plant traits evolve and how those traits link to the diversification patterns observed in the tree of life. 

We moved from UH Manoa to the University of Kentucky this Fall!
