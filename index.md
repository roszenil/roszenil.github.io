The Zenil-Ferguson lab at the University of Kentucky develops new mathematical models and statistical tools to solve key questions of plant macroevolution. Our main focus is to understand how plant traits evolve and how those traits link to the diversification patterns observed in the tree of life. 

Our lab is located at the University of Kentucky. Lexington is a great and affordable place to live
